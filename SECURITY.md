- **Game Center**: Only aggregated scores/achievements shared via Apple's Game Center
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection and processing

#### Data Categories
| Data Type | Collection | Storage | Transmission |
|-----------|------------|---------|--------------|
| Game Scores | ‚úÖ Local | üì± Device Only | üéÆ Game Center Only |
| Device Motion | ‚úÖ Temporary | üö´ Not Stored | üö´ Not Transmitted |
| Audio Data | üö´ None | üö´ None | üö´ None |
| Personal Info | üö´ None | üö´ None | üö´ None |

#### Game Center Security
- **Apple's Infrastructure**: Leverages Apple's secure Game Center backend
- **No Direct API Keys**: No custom authentication systems
- **User Consent**: Requires explicit user permission for Game Center features

### Code Security

#### Secure Development Practices
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed before merging
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Regular code security scanning
- **Input Validation**: Validation of all external inputs

#### Platform Security
- **Sandboxing**: App runs in iOS sandbox environment
- **App Store Review**: Distributed through Apple App Store security process
- **Code Signing**: All releases signed with Apple Developer certificates

- No tracking or analytics beyond crash reporting
- No personal information collection
- No location data collection

### User Rights
Users have complete control over their data:
- **Game Center**: Can be disabled without affecting core gameplay
- **Motion Data**: Temporary use only, not stored
- **Local Data**: Can be deleted by removing the app
- **No Account Creation**: No user accounts or profiles

### Transparency
- **Privacy Policy**: Clear documentation of data practices (when available)
- **Open Source**: Code available for security review
- **Regular Updates**: Privacy practices reviewed with each release

## Security Architecture

### iOS Application Security

#### App Transport Security (ATS)
```swift
// Network Security Configuration (Info.plist)
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
    <key>NSAllowsLocalNetworking</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
```

#### Keychain Usage
- **No Keychain Storage**: App doesn't store sensitive data
- **Game Center**: Authentication handled by iOS system
- **No Custom Authentication**: No passwords or tokens stored

#### Permissions
```swift
// Required Permissions (Info.plist)
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses device motion to control gravity direction for lizards.</string>

// No other permissions required:
// - No camera access
// - No microphone access
// - No location access
// - No contacts access
// - No photos access
```

### Code Security Measures

#### Memory Safety
```swift
// Safe memory management patterns
class LizardScene: SKScene {
    // Weak references prevent retain cycles
    weak var delegate: LizardSceneDelegate?
    
    // Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
    deinit {
        motionManager.stopAccelerometerUpdates()
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)
    }
}
```

#### Input Validation
```swift
// Validate physics parameters
func spawnLizard(at position: CGPoint) {
    guard position.x.isFinite && position.y.isFinite else {
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid spawn position")
        return
    }
    
    guard scene.children.count < AppConfiguration.Physics.maxPhysicsLizards else {
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Maximum lizard limit reached")
        return
    }
    
    // Safe to proceed with spawn
}
```

#### Error Handling
```swift
// Graceful error handling without crashes
func loadAudioAsset() {
    do {
        let player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: soundURL)
        // Use player safely
    } catch {
        // Log error but continue operation
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Audio loading failed: \(error)")
        // App continues to work without sound
    }
}
```
