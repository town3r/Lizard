# ‚åö Lizard for Apple Watch

The Lizard Apple Watch companion app brings the delightful physics simulation to your wrist with a native watchOS experience optimized for quick interactions and Apple Watch hardware.

## üéÆ watchOS Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Simplified Lizard Spawning**: Tap the central button to spawn animated lizards
- **SwiftUI Animations**: Smooth, native lizard animations optimized for watchOS
- **Performance Optimized**: Limited to 20 concurrent lizards for optimal watch performance  
- **Haptic Feedback**: Rich tactile feedback using WKInterfaceDevice
- **Audio Support**: Optional sound effects that respect watch audio settings

### User Interface
- **Native watchOS Design**: SwiftUI-based interface designed specifically for small screens
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in spam prevention for smooth interactions
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and large touch targets

### Cross-Platform Features
- **Score Synchronization**: Achievements and scores sync with iOS app via @AppStorage
- **Independent Operation**: Works standalone without requiring iPhone app to be running
- **GameCenter Integration**: Platform-specific achievements and leaderboards

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Performance Characteristics
- **Maximum Lizards**: 20 concurrent animated lizards (vs 300 on iOS)
- **Lizard Size**: 30pt (vs 80pt on iOS) 
- **Animation Duration**: 2.0 seconds per lizard lifecycle
- **Spawn Button**: 80pt touch target optimized for Apple Watch

### Framework Dependencies
- **SwiftUI**: Native UI framework (no SpriteKit dependency)
- **WatchKit**: For haptic feedback and device integration
- **GameKit**: For GameCenter features
- **AVFoundation**: For audio playback

### Code Architecture
- **Independent Codebase**: No shared physics engine with iOS version
- **Lightweight**: Minimal memory footprint and CPU usage
- **Battery Efficient**: Optimized animations and reduced background processing

## üéØ Gameplay Experience

### Controls
- **Single Tap**: Spawn a lizard with random animation
- **Haptic Feedback**: Gentle tap feedback on successful spawn
- **Audio Feedback**: Optional sound effect (respects watch audio settings)

### Visual Design
- **Lizard Animations**: Smooth SwiftUI-based bouncing and scaling effects
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean, uncluttered interface optimized for watch screens
- **High Contrast**: Excellent visibility in various lighting conditions

### Performance Features
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Lizards automatically disappear to maintain performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents interaction spam that could impact performance
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cleanup of animation objects

## üì± Comparison with iOS Version

| Feature | iOS Version | watchOS Version |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Physics Engine** | SpriteKit with realistic physics | SwiftUI animations |
| **Max Lizards** | 300 simultaneous | 20 simultaneous |
| **Controls** | Tap, rain mode, device tilt | Single tap only |
| **Graphics** | Advanced particle effects | Smooth SwiftUI animations |
| **Audio** | Multiple sound effects | Single spawn sound |
| **Background** | Dynamic weather system | Solid color background |
| **Haptics** | Basic touch feedback | Rich watch haptics |

## üîß Development Notes

### Requirements
- **watchOS 9.0+**: Minimum supported version
- **Apple Watch Series 4+**: Recommended for optimal performance
- **Xcode 15.0+**: Required for building

### Configuration
- **AppConfiguration.WatchOS**: Centralized settings in `AppConfiguration.swift`
- **Bundle ID**: `com.town3r.lizard.watchapp`
- **GameCenter**: Separate watchOS leaderboards and achievements

### Testing
- **watchOS Simulator**: Primary testing environment
- **Device Testing**: Required for haptic feedback validation
- **Performance Testing**: Memory and battery usage monitoring
