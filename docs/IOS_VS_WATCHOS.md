## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture Differences

### Configuration Management

Both platforms use shared `AppConfiguration.swift`, but with platform-specific sections:

```swift
enum AppConfiguration {
    // Shared configuration
    enum Physics {
        static let maxPhysicsLizards = 300  // iOS only
        static let baseLizardSize: CGFloat = 80  // iOS default
    }
    
    // Platform-specific configuration
    enum WatchOS {
        static let maxLizards = 20  // watchOS limit
        static let lizardSize: CGFloat = 30  // Smaller for watch
        static let animationDuration: TimeInterval = 2.0
        static let spawnButtonSize: CGFloat = 80
    }
}
```

### Framework Dependencies

#### iOS Dependencies
```swift
import SwiftUI
import SpriteKit
import GameKit
import AVFoundation
import CoreMotion
import MessageUI
```

#### watchOS Dependencies
