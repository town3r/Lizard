## Basic Gameplay

### Spawning Lizards

#### Single Lizard Spawn
- **Tap** the center button (ü¶é) once
- A lizard appears at the button location with random velocity
- Each tap counts toward your statistics and achievements

#### Multiple Lizard Spawn
- **Hold** the center button (ü¶é) for continuous spawning
- **Tap** the rain button (üåßÔ∏è) for a burst of lizards
- **Hold** the rain button (üåßÔ∏è) for continuous rain mode

#### Spawn Behavior
- Lizards appear with random colors and slight size variations
- Initial velocity is randomized for natural movement
- Each lizard has realistic physics properties (mass, bounce, friction)

### Controlling Gravity

#### Tilt Controls
- **Tilt your device** in any direction to change gravity
- Lizards fall toward the direction you tilt
- Smooth tilting creates natural physics flow
- Sharp tilts create dramatic direction changes

#### Gravity Mechanics
- Gravity strength is realistic (Earth-like acceleration)
- Works in all orientations (portrait, landscape, upside-down)
- Real-time response to device motion
- Supports both subtle and dramatic tilt angles

### Managing Lizards

#### Automatic Cleanup
- Lizards automatically disappear after **10 seconds**
- This prevents screen clutter and maintains performance
- No action required - cleanup is seamless

#### Manual Control
- **Stop Button (üõë)**: Pauses aging timer, lizards persist longer
- **Clear Button (üóëÔ∏è)**: Instantly removes all lizards from screen
- **Performance Limiting**: Maximum 300 lizards on iOS
