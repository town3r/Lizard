# iOS 26 Tab Bar Navigation - UI Mockup

## New Tab Bar Structure

The Lizard app now features a modern 4-tab navigation system with iOS 26 liquid glass effects:

### Tab 1: Physics üîµ
- **Icon**: ball.circle.fill  
- **Content**: Main lizard physics simulation (previously the entire ContentView)
- **Features**: 
  - Central lizard spawn button with liquid glass circle effect
  - Rain controls with enhanced liquid glass styling
  - HUD counters with GameCenter integration
  - Dynamic background switching (dynamic/solid/gradient)

### Tab 2: Settings ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Icon**: gearshape.fill
- **Content**: Comprehensive settings with navigation structure
- **Categories**:
  - Physics Settings (lizard behavior, performance)
  - Screen Orientation (gravity control)
  - Audio Settings (sound effects, volume)
  - Visual Settings (backgrounds, FPS counter)
  - Performance (monitoring and optimization)
  - About & Support (app information)

### Tab 3: Stats üèÜ
- **Icon**: trophy.fill
- **Content**: GameCenter integration and achievement tracking
- **Features**:
  - Player authentication status
  - Real-time statistics (lizards spawned, button taps, efficiency)
  - Achievement progress tracking with visual indicators
  - Leaderboard access and comparison
  - All wrapped in liquid glass sections

### Tab 4: Weather ‚òÅÔ∏è
- **Icon**: cloud.rain.fill
- **Content**: Weather controls and visual effects management
- **Features**:
  - Auto/Manual/Off weather modes
  - Rain intensity slider with real-time feedback
  - Weather condition preview grid
  - Storm effects configuration
  - Visual weather cards with descriptions

## Key Design Features

### Liquid Glass Effects
- **Tab Bar**: Enhanced with ultra-thin material and adaptive blur
- **Buttons**: iOS26LiquidGlassButton with pressed states and jitter animations
- **Sections**: LiquidGlassSection containers with depth and reflection
- **Backgrounds**: Multi-layer glass effects with proper material usage

### Navigation Enhancements
- **Smooth Transitions**: Preserved state between tab switches
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and hints for all interactive elements
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section organization with liquid glass styling
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with compositingGroup() and proper blur usage

### Preserved Functionality
- **Physics Simulation**: Unchanged core lizard physics and SpriteKit integration
- **GameCenter**: Full achievement and leaderboard functionality maintained
- **Audio System**: Complete sound effect system with rate limiting
- **Weather System**: Dynamic weather effects and time-based changes
- **Settings Persistence**: All @AppStorage preferences maintained across tabs

## Technical Implementation

The new architecture preserves all existing functionality while modernizing the navigation:
- MainTabView manages the overall structure
- Individual tab views contain focused functionality
- Shared liquid glass components ensure consistency
- Enhanced tab bar appearance with proper material usage
- Realistic iOS styling features (no fictional iOS 26 APIs)

This creates a modern, professional tab-based interface that showcases iOS design excellence while maintaining the delightful lizard physics simulation experience.
